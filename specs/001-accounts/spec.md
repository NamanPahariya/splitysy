## User story

As a person who shares costs with people I trust, I want my own Splitsy account so that my groups, expenses, balances, and settlements are private to me and remain available when I return.

## Acceptance criteria

### AC-1

Given I do not have an account
When I provide my display name, an unused email address, and a password of at least 10 characters
Then my account is created and I can enter Splitsy without confirming my email address

### AC-2

Given I do not have an account
When I provide a password shorter than 10 characters
Then my account is not created and I am told the minimum password length is 10 characters

### AC-3

Given I do not have an account
When I provide a password of at least 10 characters with any combination of characters
Then the password is accepted without any other complexity rule

### AC-4

Given an account already uses my chosen display name
When I create an account with that display name and a different email address
Then my account is created with the same display name

### AC-5

Given an account already uses an email address
When I try to create another account with that email address using any capitalisation
Then my account is not created because the email address is already in use

### AC-6

Given I already have an account
When I provide the correct email address and password
Then I enter Splitsy as myself

### AC-7

Then both attempts show the identical message, leave me signed out, and do not reveal whether the email address has an account

### AC-8

When I choose to sign out
Then I leave my account and cannot view my private information without signing in again

### AC-9
