## What this is

Splitsy remembers who paid for what when a group of people share costs, and works
out the smallest set of payments that settles everybody up.

## Who it is for

Small fixed groups who spend money together repeatedly and trust each other:
flatmates, a trip, a couple, a team lunch rota. Not merchants, not strangers,
not anyone who needs the money guaranteed.

## The problem in one sentence

After a weekend away, nobody can remember who covered which taxi, and the person
who kept the receipts ends up doing arithmetic in a group chat at midnight.

## Principles

1. **Never lose a rupee.** The parts of a split always add up to exactly the whole.
   If they cannot, we refuse the input rather than absorb the difference.
2. **History is never rewritten silently.** Correcting an expense leaves a trace.
3. **Boring beats clever.** No feature ships because it would be impressive.
4. **A stranger should understand any screen in ten seconds** without a tutorial.

## Version 1 scope

- People have their own account.
- People create groups and add other members.
- People record an expense: who paid, how much, who it was for, how to split it.
- People see what each member owes or is owed.
- People record a repayment, which changes the balances.
